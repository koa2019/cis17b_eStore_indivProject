store_html_v3.1: 
Created store_cookies.js with cookie functions that set, read
delete cookies using dr. lehr's program and tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_cookies.htm.

login.html sets the cookie with user's info and store.html reads the
cookie and creates a global instance of User and Store objects.



To-Do:

* add cart array to cookies on login?
* login.html submit button should open store.html
* add signup.html
* convert admin.cpp to admin.jss
