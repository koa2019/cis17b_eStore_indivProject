v1.1:
 * This is based off of yahtzee_v24_moveDice2SC.

 v1.3:
 * Merged yahtzee_v28.2's Admin & User Classes with store_v1.2
 

store_v2:
 * Is a copy of survey project v6.
 * Changed Question class to Item class, Votes class to Item class.
 * Added Item:: float price and nItems = 3 instead of 4. Because I needed a float.
 * Added Cart::cartTotal
 * Prints total and total number of items in Survey::start()

store_v3_itemDblPtr:
 *  Made Survey::Item item[] **item;
 * Printed checkout totals in Survey::start()

store_v4_prntCartAvgInAdmin:
 *  Calculated & printed every items purchase history in Admin::setItemHist()

store_v5:
 * Refractored Survey class to Store.
 * copy2Usr() saved cart[] elements to user2.
 * Added getCheckout() in Admin. It prints the user's order.
 * Fixed BUG: Cart::cartTotal not adjusting total when item quantity is updated in store,
   by creating temp integer array to temporarily saves the user's order until they're
   ready to checkout.
 * Added Cart::totalItems.
 * Set each player's totalItems and cartTotal after binary file is read. Inside of Admin::setItemStats().
 * Prints percentages in printItemStats().
